In this scenario you learned a bit more about what Red Hat Data Grid is, and how it can be used to for caching of frequently accessed data thus bypassing expensive database access.

We've also learned that RHDG offers in-memory caching service with or without persistence. We've seen how easy it is to
invoke cache operations over REST. REST is just one of many available protocols to access RHDG.

RHDG can be used to improve your applicationâ€™s response time, by keeping frequently and recently accessed data in a
high speed in-memory store. RHDG is one of many components of Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes - check out other scenarios (for example [the Vert.x scenario](https://learn.openshift.com)) to learn about other runtimes you can use.
